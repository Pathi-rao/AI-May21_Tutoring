******************** Rough Guide to install CUDA on your device (works only with PyTorch) ********************

Step1: Go to this link "https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10" 
	and select your OS along with the installer type (local is recommended).

Step2: The downloaded file will be an executable. Run it and it will unpack all the files into your drive.

Step3: Go to "https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/" and select the OS and dependencies and select PIP(recommended) and copy the command into your virtual environment.



	. Command to create a virtual env - " python -m venv *env_name* "
	. To activate it - " *env_name*\Scripts\activate.bat "


Step4: Once its done, select the virtual environment and run the following command in a file, 

	"	
		import torch

		print("Torch using cuda: ", torch.cuda.is_available())
	"

If it returns True, then its successfull.
